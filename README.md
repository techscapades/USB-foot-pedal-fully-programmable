# USB-foot-pedal-
A foot pedal switch that can be used for hands free presentations, cooking tutorials, and other situations when you need 3 hands or to ~stealthily~ switch tabs and even close windows if your boss happens to be walking around, perhaps even use it to activate skills games! Sometimes you really need those precious seconds to avoid a disaster!
