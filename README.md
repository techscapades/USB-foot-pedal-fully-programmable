# USB-foot-pedal-
A foot pedal switch that can be used for hands free presentations, cooking tutorials, and other situations when you need 3 hands or to ~stealthily~ switch tabs and even close windows if your boss happens to be walking around, perhaps even use it to activate skills games! Sometimes you really need those precious seconds to avoid a disaster!

Unlike many of its competitors, its completely programmable with 2 modes: short press and long press mode. Use it as a simple clicker, execute complex macros and keystrokes or as a pedal for your favourite racing game! If you want to connect more than 1 together, you simply connect them in a master/slave configuration so you save cost. But otherwise you can have as many independent ones as you have USB ports.

You can find it in my shop in carousell: https://carousell.app.link/NTrH4ZfxRjb
